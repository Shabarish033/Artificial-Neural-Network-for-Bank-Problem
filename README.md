# Deep-Learning
A deep-learning model was built for a dataset that contains information of the customers of a bank, we used this 
data set to build a classification model that predicts if the customer will stay or leave the bank.

2 deep learning codes were developed, the first is the basic code, the second uses tuning hyperparameters using Kfold cross validation and
Grid Search.
